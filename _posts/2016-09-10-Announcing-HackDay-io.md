![HackDay.io logo](/images/Hackday-logo-White.png)<br><br>Iâ€™ve run HackDays across the East Coast of Australia for two years, in collaboration with community members in each state. I love providing beginners the opportunity to learn and enabled experienced developers to connect, network and share ideas. This lead me to create HackDay.io to use my experience and expertise to connect organisations and communities around technology.<br><br>HackDay.io is focused on running community events by  developers, for developers, on a range of different technologies. Currently, we are in discussion with a range of different groups, with hopefully more announcements to come soon.
