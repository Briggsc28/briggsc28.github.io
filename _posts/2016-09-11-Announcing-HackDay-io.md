Previously I ran Xamarin and Angular Hack Days in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in collaboration with community members in each state respectively, they were fun community run events for people who want to learn and Developer ninjas alike.<br><br>The events provided beginners the opportunity to learn and enabled experienced developers to connect, network and share ideas. But after leaving SSW, I decided to keep engaging the local development community by running great events.<br><br>![HackDay.io logo](/images/Hackday-logo-White.png)<br><br>HackDay.io is focused on running community focused events by  developers, for developers, on a range of different technologies. Currently, we are in discussion with a range of different groups, with hopefully more announcements to come soon.

I am proud to announce that HackDay.io has partnered with and is actively supporting Magikcraft; a Brisbane start-up, focused on sharing the love of code with children through Minecraft. The Magikcraft team utilises incidental learning; by embedding problems into Minecraft, to teach kids to code.
