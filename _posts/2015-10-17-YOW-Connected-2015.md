I presented 'Jumping into Windows Internet of Things development by using the Universal Windows Platform' at YOW Connected 2015. The presentation was a success,  with the devices drawing a room full of curious (and a tad sceptical) devs. Ready to learn about the new Windows 10 IoT.<br><br>![Group shot of people attending](/images/CPFFhhMUkAAoLpl.jpg)The highlight of Yow Connected 2015, the conversations I had with the other attendees, which was made up of a range different skill sets spanning the mobile and IoT fields. <br><br>Thank you to the YOW team for running an excellent event. I look forward to presenting talks at future YOW events.
