In this interview, Jeremy Cade and I discuss all things:  Azure, .NET Micro Framework & Windows IoT with Pluralsight author and  Microsoft Azure MVP Ilija Injac.

> We had a lot of fun recording this interview with Ilija . Therefore, I would recommend watching it even if you haven't yet taken the plunge into IoT with .NET. 

Be sure to check out [Ilija's blog](http://www.awsomedevsigner.com/), which provides interesting insights into Windows 10 IoT Core, NETMF and Azure.
