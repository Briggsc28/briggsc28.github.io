![HackDay.io Magikcraft logos](/images/Hackday-Magikcraft.png)<br><br>I am proud to announce that HackDay.io has partnered with and is actively supporting Magikcraft; a Brisbane start-up, focused on sharing the love of code with children through Minecraft. The Magikcraft team utilises incidental learning; by embedding problems into Minecraft, to teach kids to code.
