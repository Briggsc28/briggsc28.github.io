Yesterday, we hosted the first ever Angular Hack Day Sydney. Hackdays are a regularly run fun event where a range of developers come together to learn from each other. The focus of the event got people over their beginner's block with Angular 2 and they ended the day loving Angular 2.

<br>The day opened with a warm welcome from Adam Cogan. He left the room in stitches with the story of SSW’s herculean effort to renovate the [sparklingly new 180 square meters venue](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/Venues/Hire-Conference-Room.aspx) in a week. This was followed up with 3 x 15-minute lightning talks. The topics started at the basics of Angular 2 and finished peering into the future of Angular 2 development.

Many thanks to our speaker line-up:

* Adam Cogan – How to renovate in 6 days + [Rules to Better Angular 2](https://rules.ssw.com.au/rules-to-better-angular-2)
* Duncan Hunter – Angular 2 in 15 minutes.
* Aliaksei Kuncevich – Angular2 From Handling and Validation.
* Mohamed Meligy – Demystifying Observables and RxJS.
* Chris Briggs – Angular 2 101 – Angular-CLI.

Once the lighting talks finished, half the attendees commenced hacking with Angular 2. Duncan led the remaining eager hackers on a crash course through setting up and the basics of Angular 2.

The speakers helped unblock attendees when they become stuck thought out the day. It was great seeing attendees working together, to unblock themselves. Special thank you to Michael Dausmann, who jumped in head first, and we lost count of how many people he unblocked.
In the afternoon, the attendees got up, shared what they wrote and had learned. The were 12 presentations and as one of the organisers of the Angular Hack Day, it was incredible seeing so many of the people get up at the end of the day and show the solution they had developed that day.

I believe that everyone who wrote an app on the day was a winner. Up until this point, only one could hold the trophy aloft. For the first time in Hack Day history, we had a dead heat. The panel of judges made up of Adam, Tamba and myself were unable to decide between Jason Stone & Michael Dausmann.

It was great getting to work with Sydney community leaders, Adam Cogan & Mohamed Meligy. Who helped me with a range of tasks leading up to the event. It would have been impossible to run Angular Hack Day Sydney, without the support of our sponsors, SSW and Command Recruiting group. <br><br>We have already begun planning the next Angular Hack Day Sydney.  The Hack Day team are excited to bring together more passionate developers to get together learn from each other and share the Angular love.<br><br>Hack Days are community events which have been run all over the world including the US, China, and Europe. This week we were excited to add Ljubljana, Slovenia & Gothenburg, Sweden to the list of cities hosting Angular Hack Days. Are you interested in having an Angular Hack Day near you?
