I am the lead organiser of [Xamarin Hack Day](http://xamarinhackday.com/) a community initiative by [SSW](https://www.ssw.com.au/) for Brisbane, Sydney & Melbourne. It's a free event where attendees are taught in the morning about the basics of Xamarin through a series of 15-minute lighting talks by experts.

<br>In the afternoon, they fire up their computers and code an app in groups with the experts on hand, ready to unblock them.<br><br>![With the experts on hand, ready to unblock them.](/images/ExpertsOnHand.jpg)<br><br>The last Xamarin Hack Day had 40 attendees in Melbourne, which was hosted the weekend after Microsoft had purchased Xamarin. We considered the turn out excellent due to Xamarin being a niche product and the most expensive option to use in the cross-platform mobile app space.<br><br>The questions most commonly thrown around at the most recent Xamarin Hack Day was _'Why doesn't my app work?'_  followed by something along the lines of: 

* _Attendee: How much does Xamarin cost?_
* Me: There's a range of licencing options available but a single licence is $999 US per year.
* _Attendee: (gulp) Oh ok well_ 
* Me: Microsoft brought Xamarin, hopefully the licence will be included as a part of MSDN

Or 

* Me:  Whats the first thing you hope Microsoft does with Xamarin?
* _Attendee: Make the licence as a part of MSDN_

We all thought it would never be free; it couldn't be, not after Microsoft had paid a pretty penny for Xamarin. But this is one of the few time I am ecstatic to be wrong:

> Xamarin in Visual Studio at no extra cost & the Xamarin SDKs for Android, iOS, and Mac will be open sourced in the next few months!

Breaking down the major issue of cost is a massive boost to the Xamarin community. I am looking forward to seeing how the community and Xamarin Hack Day grows over the next 12 months.<br><br>These Hack Days are community events which have been run all over the world including the US, China and Europe.
