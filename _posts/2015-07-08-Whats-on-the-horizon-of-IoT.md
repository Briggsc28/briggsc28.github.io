In this interview I speak to the creator of [Internet of Things Australia](http://www.iotaustralia.org.au/), Stuart Corner. He is one of Australia’s most experienced writers and commentators on telecommunications. Stuart has been following the industry since 1984 and for over 20 years he published Exchange, a weekly subscription newsletter for the Australian Telecommunications Industry. Today he contributes IT news and features to a number of publications and undertakes a variety of corporate IT writing projects.

> Stuart shares his enthusiasm for the potential of IoT in the everyday world and what developers can look forward to with IoT development.
