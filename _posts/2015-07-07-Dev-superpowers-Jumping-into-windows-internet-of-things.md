In this presentation, Chris Briggs will teach you how to jump head first into Windows Internet of Things (IoT) development by using the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), allowing developers to build one solution across Microsoft hardware platforms.  

You will learn the basics of Windows Universal app development with a focus on building apps for devices running Windows 10 IoT Core, through to how to integrate the solution with Windows Azure.  

You will see Chris build a simple Universal app, deploy it to Raspberry Pi 2, then expand upon the application to read input from sensors and finally establish communication with Azure. This will demonstrate how to take a simple “hello world” thing and make it a useful citizen of IoT.

Windows IoT development using Universal apps will make it obvious that there is no better time as a .Net developer to jump into IoT!
