Rounding up the first ever series of Angular Hack Days, was Angular Hack Day Brisbane, after the previous events had packed out our venues, it was very encouraging to see Brisbane, my home town do the same.

In the morning, the attendees were taught the basics of Angular 2 through a series of 15-minute lighting talks by experts. Many thanks to our speaker line-up for the event:

* Adam Stephensen – Angular 2 in 15 minutes.
* Scott Barnes – Adaptive and Responsive Design devs walk into a bar...
* Chris Briggs – Angular 2 101 – Angular-CLI.

After the round of lighting talks, Adam took attendees on an extended Angular 2 101 class which taught them a crash course on Angular 2.

In the afternoon, the attendees got up, shared what they wrote and presented on what they had learned. Although everyone who wrote an app on the day was a winner. In the end, only one can hold the Trophy aloft, congratulations to Jason Taylor.

Lastly as someone who has organized hack days for both Xamarin and Angular in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne; I can say without a doubt that it would be tough to run this event without our sponsors: Microsoft Innovation Centre, Just Digital People, and SSW.
